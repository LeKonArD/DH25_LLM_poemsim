Your Task is to judge the similarity of poems. Consider the following three poems (POEM_MAIN, POEM_A, POEM_B) and judge whether POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A than POEM_B or more similar to POEM_B than POEM_A or equally (dis)similar to both POEM_A and POEM_B:

When you evaluate, you should consider the following dimensions of similarity separately: content, style, form, emotion and overall.

- **Content**: Focus on theme, setting, entities, plot, and message.
- **Emotion**: Consider overall emotionality, polarity, and individual emotions.
- **Style**: Examine word choice, figurative language, repetitions, and syntax.
- **Form**: Look at stanza structure, rhyme, meter, and text length.
- **Overall**: Consider the combined aspects of content, emotion, style, and form.

Format your answer like this:
Begin with ‚ANSWER: ‘
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A than POEM_B, write ‘POEM_A’.
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_B than POEM_A, write ‚POEM_B‘.
If POEM_MAIN is equally (dis)similar to both POEM_A and POEM_B, write ‚BOTH‘.

Your completed answer should resemble this example (in valid json), with no additional commentary:

ANSWER:

{"content": "POEM_A",
"style": "BOTH",
"form": "POEM_B",
"emotion": "BOTH",
"overall": "POEM_A"}

POEM_MAIN:
{{POEM_MAIN_TEXT}}

POEM_A:
{{POEM_A_TEXT}}

POEM_B:
{{POEM_B_TEXT}}
