Your Task is to judge the similarity of poems. Consider the following three poems (POEM_MAIN, POEM_A, POEM_B) and judge whether POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A than POEM_B or more similar to POEM_B than POEM_A or equally (dis)similar to both POEM_A and POEM_B:

When you evaluate, you should consider the following dimensions of similarity separately: content, style, form, emotion and overall.

To determine your answer, follow a step-by-step reasoning process:

1. Analyze each dimension of similarity individually (content, emotion, style, form).
2. Compare POEM_MAIN with POEM_A and POEM_MAIN with POEM_B for each dimension.
3. Decide which poem POEM_MAIN is more similar to in each dimension or if the similarity is equal.
4. Based on these observations, determine the overall similarity.


Format your answer like this:
Begin with ‚ANSWER: ‘
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A than POEM_B, write ‘POEM_A’.
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_B than POEM_A, write ‚POEM_B‘.
If POEM_MAIN is equally (dis)similar to both POEM_A and POEM_B, write ‚BOTH‘.

Your completed answer should resemble this example (in valid json):

ANSWER:

{"content": "POEM_A",
"style": "BOTH",
"form": "POEM_B",
"emotion": "BOTH",
"overall": "POEM_A"}

POEM_MAIN:
{{POEM_MAIN_TEXT}}

POEM_A:
{{POEM_A_TEXT}}

POEM_B:
{{POEM_B_TEXT}}
