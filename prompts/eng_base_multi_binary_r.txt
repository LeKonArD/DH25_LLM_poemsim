Your task is to evaluate the similarity of poems. Analyze the following three poems (POEM_MAIN, POEM_A, and POEM_B) to determine whether POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A or POEM_B based on the specified dimensions of similarity. Use the aspects below for your assessment:

- **Content**
- **Emotion**
- **Style**
- **Form**
- **Overall**

To determine your answer, follow a step-by-step reasoning process:

1. Analyze each dimension of similarity individually (content, emotion, style, form).
2. Compare POEM_MAIN with POEM_A and POEM_MAIN with POEM_B for each dimension.
3. Decide which poem POEM_MAIN is more similar to in each dimension.
4. Based on these observations, determine the overall similarity.

Format your answer as follows:
Begin with 'ANSWER: '.
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A, write 'POEM_A'.
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_B, write 'POEM_B'.

Your response should look like this example (valid json):

ANSWER:

{"content": "POEM_A",
"style": "POEM_B",
"form": "POEM_B",
"emotion": "POEM_A",
"overall": "POEM_A"}

POEM_MAIN:
{{POEM_MAIN_TEXT}}

POEM_A:
{{POEM_A_TEXT}}

POEM_B:
{{POEM_B_TEXT}}
