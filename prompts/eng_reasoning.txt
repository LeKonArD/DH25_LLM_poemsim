Your Task is to judge the similarity of poems. Consider the following three poems (POEM_MAIN, POEM_A, POEM_B) and judge whether POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A than POEM_B or more similar to POEM_B than POEM_A or equally (dis)similar to both POEM_A and POEM_B:

POEM_MAIN:
{{POEM_MAIN_TEXT}}

POEM_A:
{{POEM_A_TEXT}}

POEM_B:
{{POEM_B_TEXT}}

In your judgment, focus on {DIMENSION}. Do not consider any other text dimensions.

Format your answer like this:
Begin with ‚ANSWER: ‘
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A than POEM_B, write ‘POEM_A’.
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_B than POEM_A, write ‚POEM_B‘.
If POEM_MAIN is equally (dis)similar to both POEM_A and POEM_B, write ‚BOTH‘.
After ‚ANSWER: ‘, do not write anything else than ‘POEM_A’, ‘POEM_B’ or ‚BOTH‘.
In the next line, write ‚REASONING: ‚‘ followed by your reasoning.

For example, your complete answer could look like this:

ANSWER: BOTH
REASONING: All three poems focus on …
