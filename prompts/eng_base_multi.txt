Your Task is to judge the similarity of poems. Consider the following three poems (POEM_MAIN, POEM_A, POEM_B) and judge whether POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A than POEM_B or more similar to POEM_B than POEM_A or equally (dis)similar to both POEM_A and POEM_B:

POEM_MAIN:
{{POEM_MAIN_TEXT}}

POEM_A:
{{POEM_A_TEXT}}

POEM_B:
{{POEM_B_TEXT}}

When you evaluate, you should consider the following dimensions of similarity separately: content, style, form, emotion and overall.

Format your answer like this:
Begin with ‚ANSWER: ‘
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A than POEM_B, write ‘POEM_A’.
If POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_B than POEM_A, write ‚POEM_B‘.
If POEM_MAIN is equally (dis)similar to both POEM_A and POEM_B, write ‚BOTH‘.

For example, your complete answer should look like this, do not write anything beyond that:

ANSWER:

content: POEM_A
style: BOTH
form: POEM_B
emotion: BOTH
overall: POEM_A
