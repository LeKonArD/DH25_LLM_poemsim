  - **Emotion:** The emotional tone is melancholic and contemplative, feeling nostalgic about happier times, while dealing with an undercurrent of sadness or longing.
  - **Style:** Rich with imagery, figurative language (e.g., metaphors like ""water of remembrance"" and ""water of forgetfulness""), and a rhythmic structure that supports its philosophical pondering.
  - **Form:** Consists of two stanzas with a rhyme scheme that follows ABBAA and ABBAA, maintaining consistency in meter and form.

- **Summary POEM_A:**  
  - **Content:** This poem addresses themes of internal pain and the comfort derived from a loved one's presence, despite the pain they may inadvertently cause.
  - **Emotion:** The tone is intimate and sorrowful, with a blend of emotional pain and solace. There's a deep personal conflict.
  - **Style:** Uses direct and evocative language focusing on physical sensations and emotional states, with some repetition to emphasize pain and comfort.
  - **Form:** Structured in three stanzas with an unusual free verse style, lacking a strict rhyme scheme but maintaining rhythm through repetition and parallel constructions.

- **Summary POEM_B:**  
  - **Content:** The poem deals with themes of regret, betrayal, and passion. It reflects on impulsive actions done in the night, facing the consequences by morning.
  - **Emotion:** Exhibits a turbulent mix of passion and remorse. The poem conveys a sense of regret mixed with the allure of temptation.

- **Form:** POEM_MAIN shares structural elements more closely with POEM_B, both having a maintained rhyme scheme and rhythmic quality. POEM_A's absence of strict rhyme rules sets it apart structurally.

  - **Form:** Structured in concise stanzas with a rhyming scheme that adds to the lyrical nature of the poem.

- **Summary POEM_A:**
