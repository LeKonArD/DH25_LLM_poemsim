**Reasoning:**

1. **Content**:

   - **POEM_A** also contains a religious theme, addressing God directly and contemplating human fragility and divine presence.

   - Therefore, POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A in terms of content.

2. **Emotion**:
   - **POEM_MAIN** conveys an awe towards nature and divinity, with a solemn, reverential tone.
   - **POEM_A** expresses emotions of plea and longing, directed at a higher power, sharing a similar reverential and solemn tone.
   - **POEM_B** has a lighter, more descriptive emotional tone focused on daily life and nature.
   - POEM_MAIN and POEM_A share a deeper emotional resonance, focusing on spirituality and introspection.

3. **Style**:
   - **POEM_MAIN** uses elevated language and addresses a grand theme succinctly.
   - **POEM_A** employs similar elevated language with direct address to God, along with focused, introspective contemplation.
   - **POEM_B** uses more descriptive, straightforward language to depict a natural scene and human activity.
   - The style of POEM_MAIN resembles that of POEM_A more due to the similar diction and contemplative style.

4. **Form**:
   - **POEM_MAIN** is short, with dense meaning packed into its few lines.
   - **POEM_A** is also constructed with dense thematic content, structured for deep introspection, aligning with POEM_MAIN’s form.
   - **POEM_B** is longer, with more stanzas dedicated to creating a scene, differing in form compared to POEM_MAIN.

**Explanation:**

1. **Content**: 
   - POEM_MAIN and POEM_B share more thematic similarity. Both have motifs involving natural elements (the earth/ground in POEM_MAIN, and the sea/star in POEM_B) as part of a broader reflection on depth and ultimate fate. POEM_A, meanwhile, deals primarily with personal emotions (love/hate) and resilience against life's challenges, which is somewhat different.
   - POEM_MAIN is more aligned with POEM_B's idea of inevitable immersion and submission to natural forces.

2. **Emotion**: 
   - POEM_MAIN expresses a sense of acceptance and reconciliation with the inevitable, similar to POEM_B's mood of resignation and fate. Both evoke a quieter, reflective emotional response.
   - POEM_A, however, centers on more active and forceful emotions like love and hatred and confrontational attitudes towards adversity. POEM_B echoes the subdued emotions present in POEM_MAIN.

3. **Style**:
   - Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B utilize a more descriptive and contemplative style, using language to evoke the imagery of natural settings and existential themes. POEM_B’s imagery of a falling star parallels the earth imagery in POEM_MAIN.
   - POEM_A uses language inviting strong emotional responses, focusing on interpersonal themes, differing from POEM_MAIN’s style.

4. **Form**:
   - POEM_MAIN and POEM_B have a focus on structure and a natural flow that enhances their contemplative qualities. Both feature similar stanzaic patterns and lengths. POEM_A, while poetically structured, relies less on these elements than it does on its more argumentative tone.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Content**: The primary theme of POEM_MAIN involves a reflection on the transient beauty of life, comparing humans to fleeting flowers, and acknowledging the inevitability of death. POEM_A revolves around a more specific narrative about a child's death and the afterlife, which, while it touches on mortality and continuation beyond death, feels narrower in scope. POEM_B, on the other hand, also deals with themes of childhood, memory, and the ephemeral nature of beauty and life, akin to POEM_MAIN's contemplation of transience through the metaphor of flowers.

2. **Emotion**: POEM_MAIN evokes a somber yet tender reflection on transience and loss, focusing on the sorrow of forgetting. This aligns more closely with POEM_B, which deals with themes of wistfulness and gentle grief over lost childhood innocence and memories. POEM_A, while poignant, has a different emotional focus, centering on consolation and the serene vision of a child in heaven, a more specific emotional context.

3. **Style**: POEM_MAIN utilizes floral metaphors and a lyrical tone to convey its message. POEM_B employs similar natural imagery, specifically flowers, to communicate its themes, using a comparable style with metaphor and gentle, melancholic language. POEM_A is more narrative-focused, explaining a situation more than creating an abstract or generalized emotional atmosphere.

4. **Form**: Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B share a relatively similar stanza structure, with a consistent rhyme and rhythm, creating a harmonious and reflective mood. POEM_A is shorter and structured to convey a narrative conversation between a grandmother and children, differing significantly from POEM_MAIN's lyrical meditation.

2. **Emotion**:
   - POEM_MAIN conveys a sense of stoic acceptance of one's nature and a gentle reproach regarding understanding this nature.
   - POEM_A carries an emotionally neutral to positive tone, reflecting duty and the constructive interaction of social roles.
   - POEM_B creates a soothing and calming emotional state, offering rest and peace.
   
   Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_A exhibit emotions relating to character or duty, whereas POEM_B emphasizes tranquility and rest. POEM_MAIN shares more emotional similarity with POEM_A.

3. **Style**:
   - POEM_MAIN uses contrasts (e.g., ""winter night"" vs. ""young May"") and a didactic tone with metaphor related to trees.
   - POEM_A employs straightforward language detailing social structure without significant metaphorical or figurative language.
   - POEM_B employs gentle, lyrical, and calming language with significant use of figurative language and soothing imagery.
   
   The stylistic elements in POEM_MAIN such as metaphor and contrasting images align more closely with POEM_B, even though the mood and tone are quite different.

4. **Form**:
   - POEM_MAIN consists of three quatrains with consistent rhyme (ABAB) and meter.
   - POEM_A is also concise, with a simple rhyme scheme, focusing on direct communication.
   - POEM_B is longer, lyrical, with repetition and a more complex structure (additional rhyme and rhythm elements).

**Overall**:
When considering the combination of content, emotion, style, and form, POEM_MAIN leans towards POEM_A in terms of content, emotion, and form, while only style slightly resembles POEM_B. Thus, overall, POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A.

1. **Content**: 
   - POEM_MAIN has themes of anticipation, nature, and time with entities such as the sun, wind, flowers, and heart. 
   - POEM_A discusses duty and love, which does not align closely with the natural and temporal themes of POEM_MAIN.

1. **Content**:
   - **POEM_MAIN**: Describes a surreal dream of a boat journey involving death and a mystical, smiling helmsman as dawn breaks.
   - **POEM_A**: Focuses on themes of belief, destruction, and unity, centering on an emotional, personal relationship.
   - **POEM_B**: Centers on life as a metaphorical sea voyage, emphasizing navigation through adversities with guidance from a benevolent pilot.
   - **Comparison**: The primary theme in POEM_MAIN is a dreamlike journey on a boat, with existential and ethereal undertones similar to POEM_B's metaphor of life's journey at sea. POEM_A is more personal and intimate, focusing on relationship dynamics rather than a broader metaphorical journey.

2. **Emotion**:
   - **POEM_MAIN**: Evokes a mysterious, somewhat eerie and somber emotionality with the imagery of dead bodies and a pale helmsman, coupled with a peaceful morning.
   - **POEM_A**: Contains intense emotions of belief, destruction, sadness, unity, and personal turmoil.
   - **POEM_B**: Offers a more serene and hopeful emotional tone, focusing on trust and overcoming life’s adversities.
   - **Comparison**: POEM_MAIN's mysterious and somber emotions align more with POEM_A’s intense and tumultuous emotionality, though the context differs. POEM_B's hopeful tone contrasts more with the somberness of POEM_MAIN.

3. **Style**:
   - **POEM_MAIN**: Uses vivid imagery and metaphor, with a formal and lyrical tone, possibly using complex sentence structures.
   - **POEM_A**: Direct, emotional, and lyrical, with a focus on strong personal pronouns and emotional language with less metaphorical content.
   - **POEM_B**: Utilizes metaphor consistently (life as a sea journey), clear and straightforward language, and formal style with a positive tone.
   - **Comparison**: POEM_MAIN and POEM_B both use metaphorical language about a journey. POEM_A focuses more directly on personal emotion and less on extended metaphor.

4. **Form**:
   - **POEM_MAIN**: Consists of a single stanza and uses rhyme, though meter is less clear.
   - **POEM_A**: Consists of two stanzas with a regular rhyme scheme, focusing on short lines.
   - **POEM_B**: Features multiple stanzas with a clear rhyme scheme and likely a consistent meter, typical of folk or fable-like poetry.
   - **Comparison**: POEM_MAIN’s form is closer to POEM_A's shorter stanzas and focused message. POEM_B has more detailed stanza structure and meter.

Based on these analyses, the overall similarity is determined as follows:

   - **POEM_MAIN** reflects on past youth, memories, and perhaps unfulfilled love. It mentions student days and the lasting memory held by a woman as life changes and grows.
   - **POEM_A** deals with themes of night, completion, and perhaps reflection; it uses the metaphor of a well, but doesn't closely align with the specific memories of youth and lost chances like POEM_MAIN.

   - **POEM_MAIN** carries emotional weight of nostalgia, sadness, and longing—focusing on lamenting the past and cherished memories.

   Conclusion: POEM_B is more emotionally similar to POEM_MAIN.

**Content:**  
- **POEM_MAIN** revolves around the secret affection and dreams of love. It carries a sense of longing and intimate connection, albeit in a dream.
- **POEM_A** also discusses love, with a nostalgic reminiscence of past intimate moments (""Wie einst im Mai""), and includes a setting invoking flowers, the past, and a sense of freedom.
- **POEM_B** explores love as a fated and eternal bond, with themes of destiny and cosmic alignment.

**Comparison:**  
The theme of love is present in all three, but POEM_MAIN and POEM_A share the element of intimate and secret encounters or feelings, as well as a certain temporal context (dreams in POEM_MAIN and memories in POEM_A). POEM_B's theme is more about eternal destiny rather than secretive or temporal love.  
- **Content Similarity:** POEM_A

**Emotion:**  
- **POEM_MAIN** conveys a sense of secret happiness and longing wrapped in dreams.
- **POEM_A** is emotionally nostalgic and slightly bold in love, expressing a longing for past intimacy.
- **POEM_B** expresses a deep, eternal love, full of yearning but with an ultimate sense of fulfillment in destiny.

**Comparison:**  
The emotional tone of longing and secret joy in POEM_MAIN aligns more closely with the nostalgic and intimate longing of POEM_A. POEM_B, with its more profound, eternal love tone, diverges in its emotionality.  
- **Emotion Similarity:** POEM_A

**Style:**  
- **POEM_MAIN** employs intimate, secretive language with repetitions emphasizing dreams.
- **POEM_A** uses romantic and nostalgic imagery, with a somewhat straightforward style.
- **POEM_B** contains more abstract, metaphoric language, dealing with destiny and cosmic imagery.

**Comparison:**  
POEM_MAIN's repetition and focus on dreams are stylistically closer to the straightforward, intimate language of POEM_A. POEM_B’s use of metaphors related to fate makes it stylistically different.  
- **Style Similarity:** POEM_A

**Form:**  
- **POEM_MAIN** consists of short stanzas with a consistent rhyme scheme.
- **POEM_A** also short stanzas and a clear rhyme, along with a balanced structure.
- **POEM_B** has a similar stanza structure but includes more complex syntax and possibly a different meter.

**Comparison:**  
Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_A share a consistent form in terms of stanza structure and rhyme scheme, while POEM_B's form includes complex syntax and abstraction.  
- **Form Similarity:** POEM_A

**Overall:**  
Assessing all dimensions—content, emotion, style, and form—POEM_MAIN is more closely aligned with POEM_A in each category due to their shared themes of secret or nostalgic love, emotional tone, intimate and straightforward style, and consistent form.
