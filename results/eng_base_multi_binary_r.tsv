1. **Content**:  
   POEM_MAIN talks about contrasting thoughts and memories, the transition between past and present, and the themes of forgetting and remembering.

3. **Style**:

### Content
- **POEM_MAIN**: Discusses themes of adventure, chivalric imagery, and a sense of urgency involving retrieving a sword and searching the sky.
- **POEM_A**: Focuses on the power of art and beauty, how it can influence, harmonize, and transcend worldly struggles.
- **POEM_B**: Explores themes of love and the change of seasons, contrasting first and last loves.

**Comparison**: POEM_MAIN is more about an immediate personal experience and action, while POEM_A talks about the abstract influence of art, and POEM_B discusses personal emotions with natural imagery. In terms of overarching narrative and personal endeavor, POEM_B, which discusses personal emotional experiences, feels slightly more aligned content-wise with the urgency and personal quest in POEM_MAIN, as opposed to the abstractness of POEM_A.

### Emotion
- **POEM_MAIN**: Conveys a sense of urgency and a desire to act, with a somewhat rebellious or independent spirit.
- **POEM_A**: Evokes the transcendent and transformative power of art, with an overall feeling of beauty and harmony.
- **POEM_B**: Displays a nostalgic reflection on first and last loves, with sentiments of warmth and impending change or loss (winter).

**Comparison**: POEM_MAIN’s theme of adventure carries a mix of urgency and a call to action, which aligns less with the serene and harmonious emotions in POEM_A. The emotional content of nostalgia and contemplation in POEM_B, although different, carries a personal introspection that may relate more closely to the active sentiment in POEM_MAIN.

### Style
- **POEM_MAIN**: Utilizes direct, imperative language to express urgency and command.
- **POEM_A**: Employs richly descriptive and formal language to discuss art’s influence with long lines and structured rhyme.
- **POEM_B**: Features simple, rhythmic language with a reflective, lyrical tone.

**Comparison**: The direct commands and straightforward desires of POEM_MAIN resonate less with POEM_A's intellectual and nuanced stylistic features. POEM_B’s straightforward and lyrical style, while reflective, seems closer to the simpler expressiveness of POEM_MAIN.

### Form
- **POEM_MAIN**: A short poem with a direct, imperative structure, conveying energy and urgency.
- **POEM_A**: Longer and more structured, with rhymed couplets and a didactic feel.
- **POEM_B**: Rhymed stanzas, more regular in rhythm and structure, generally more lyrical.

**Comparison**: While both POEM_A and POEM_B have structured forms, POEM_MAIN’s brevity, defined by quick, immediate expressions, lacks the elaborate formality of POEM_A. POEM_B, with its more straightforward approach, mirrors POEM_MAIN's relative simplicity in form better than the complex structure of POEM_A.

### Overall
Considering all dimensions, POEM_MAIN exhibits more similarity in content themes and stylistic elements with POEM_B. Its emotional urgency and relatively simple form and style align more closely with the reflective, nature-related themes and straightforward style of POEM_B than with the more abstract, formal, and intellectually contemplative nature of POEM_A.

**Content**:  
POEM_MAIN discusses themes of hope, trust, and perseverance, suggesting that as long as we maintain hope, everything will be fine, even if that hope is a dream. POEM_B also revolves around the theme of hope, personified as a flower that needs care and has a deep connection with the heart.

**Emotion**:  
POEM_MAIN evokes emotions of optimism and solace by emphasizing hope as a means to dry one's tears. POEM_B similarly uses hope symbolically as a cherished flower that is nurtured emotionally, aligning with the emotional tenor of POEM_MAIN. POEM_A is more intellectual, comparing and contrasting concepts without much emotional depth. Thus, for emotion, POEM_B is more akin to POEM_MAIN.

**Style**:  
The style of POEM_MAIN is imbued with gentle encouragement and soothing imagery, focusing on emotional and abstract concepts. POEM_B uses a similar style, employing metaphor and personification of hope as a flower to convey its message, which aligns stylistically with POEM_MAIN. POEM_A, meanwhile, adopts a more direct and philosophical tone, differing in stylistic approach. Therefore, POEM_B is stylistically closer to POEM_MAIN.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Content**: POEM_MAIN and POEM_A both deal with a connection to places (a homeland in the former; an abbey in the latter) and the associated feelings of nostalgia and yearning.

**Content**:
- **POEM_MAIN** deals with the theme of sadness and unreciprocated love, featuring a metaphor of the sky weeping, drawing a parallel between the sky's tears and human emotion.
- **POEM_A** similarly explores themes of sadness, unfulfilled life ('ungelebten Lebens'), and the melancholy of lost or unattainable experiences. The imagery of shadows and nameless sorrow resonates closely with the content of POEM_MAIN.
- **POEM_B**, while also melancholic, is focused on themes of death and mourning, emphasizing the physical imagery of the rose and funeral preparation. The content distinction of death rites diverges more from POEM_MAIN than POEM_A's introspective sadness.

**Emotion**:
- **POEM_MAIN** conveys an emotion of sadness and a possible sense of longing or regret related to unfulfilled love.
- **POEM_A** expresses deep sorrow and melancholy, which aligns closely with the emotional tone of POEM_MAIN. The felt 'namenloser Trauer' underscores a comparable profound, unnamed sadness.
- **POEM_B** conveys sorrow but with a stark grief and mourning over death, which contrasts with the more abstract emotional longing and sadness in POEM_MAIN.

**Style**:
- **POEM_MAIN** uses metaphorical language and personification, giving life to the sky’s sadness as if it were a human experience.
- **POEM_A** showcases similar stylistic features, with rich metaphorical language ('Blutrubin', 'traumschwer') and an imagistic exploration of abstracts such as 'seele' and 'namenloser Trauer'. This resonates with POEM_MAIN's metaphorical personification.
- **POEM_B** is more descriptive and narrative in its style and lacks the abstract personification and metaphor found in POEM_MAIN.

**Form**:
- **POEM_MAIN** uses a compact stanzaic form with rhyme schemes that add a rhythmic quality.
- **POEM_A** follows a similar form with use of rhyme, enjambment, and structured stanzas that mirror POEM_MAIN’s formal structure.
- **POEM_B**, while also structured, seems to follow a more narrative, less evocative stanza form, focusing more on sequencing events.
