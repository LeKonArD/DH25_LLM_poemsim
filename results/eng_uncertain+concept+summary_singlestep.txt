Summary POEM_MAIN:  
**Content:** POEM_MAIN explores themes of humility, virtue, and societal change. It criticizes a false sense of humility instilled by a powerful class, suggesting a loss of genuine strength and character. It also hints at disapproval of religious or moral indoctrination.  
**Emotion:** The emotions conveyed are critical and somewhat defiant, with a hint of regret for lost virtues and disdain for artificial attributes created by authorities.  
**Style:** The poem uses direct language with a slightly formal tone. It utilizes a mixture of imagery associated with light and sight, contrasted with humility and servitude. The vocabulary is straightforward, mostly focusing on abstract concepts.  
**Form:** The poem has a structured stanzaic form but does not have a regular rhyme scheme or meter, making it free-form in appearance and structure. Its length is relatively short.

Summary POEM_A:  
**Content:** POEM_A is centered around vivid natural imagery and creates an atmosphere rather than conveying a direct message or narrative. It describes various elements of nature like peacocks, reeds, and mimosas, creating a sensory experience.  
**Emotion:** The poem evokes a sense of calm and contemplation through the use of languid, sensuous imagery of nature. It's meditative and serene, yet somewhat somber.  
**Style:** The poem is rich in descriptive language, employing sensory metaphors and imagery to create a vivid picture. The style is lyric and imagistic.  
**Form:** The poem lacks a consistent rhyme scheme or meter but follows a coherent structure through its imagery. The form is fragmented and concise, filled with unexpected juxtapositions.

Summary POEM_B:  
**Content:** POEM_B describes a peaceful, perhaps nostalgic, setting involving two young people walking in a park behind two elegant women. It suggests a leisurely and somewhat aristocratic scene framed by a possibly romantic or aspirational narrative.  
**Emotion:** The emotions are gentle, serene, and contemplative, with an undertone of nostalgia or reminiscence. There is a feeling of calmness and grace.  
**Style:** The poem is wordy yet delicate in its language choice, focusing on visual and sensory detail. The tone is narrative but laced with rich descriptions.  
**Form:** The poem is presented in sentence-like structures with no particular rhyme scheme, extended metaphor, or direct formality. The lines are varied in length.

Explanation:

- **Content:** POEM_A and POEM_MAIN both rely heavily on descriptive imagery, albeit in different contexts (nature vs concepts of humility and virtue). POEM_B, with its slight narrative and nostalgic setting, stands apart in terms of theme and message.
  
- **Style:** All three poems use rich descriptions and imagistic language, though POEM_MAIN’s focus on abstract concepts gives it a somewhat different angle. Both POEM_A and POEM_B are equally distant in style but still share common literary elements with POEM_MAIN.
  
- **Form:** POEM_B, with its longer, more narrative lines, aligns more closely with POEM_MAIN, which also lacks a strict rhyme scheme or meter but maintains a narrative-like quality through abstract contemplation.

- **Emotion:** POEM_MAIN’s defiance and calm observation can relate to both POEM_A’s serene contemplation of nature and POEM_B’s nostalgic tranquility, indicating a lack of strong emotional alignment with either.

- **Overall:** POEM_A shares more common elements with POEM_MAIN, such as the use of metaphor and imagery, despite different subject matter. This gives it a closer similarity overall compared to POEM_B."	"[""Summaries\n\nSummary POEM_MAIN:  \n**Content:** POEM_MAIN explores themes of humility, virtue, and societal change.

Summary POEM_A:

**Emotion:** The poem is intensely emotional with themes of passion, destruction, and union. It oscillates between violent emotional upheavals and deep connections, creating an overall tumultuous yet intimate affective register.
**Style:** Rich in emotional and evocative language, the poem uses metaphors effectively, such as the storm and the sea, to convey its themes. The vocabulary suggests turbulence and intensity.

Result:

{'content': 'POEM_B', 
'style': 'BOTH', 
'form': 'POEM_B', 
'emotion': 'BOTH', 
'overall': 'BOTH'}

**Explanation:**

- **Content:** POEM_MAIN and POEM_B both evoke themes tied to the sea, journey, and a guiding figure (the helmsman in POEM_MAIN and the ""friendly pilot"" in POEM_B), while POEM_A pivots on personal emotions of belief and destruction, making POEM_MAIN more similar to POEM_B.
  
- **Style:** Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B use rich imagery and metaphors related to journeys and fate, though POEM_A stands out with its evocative and personal style. However, in the linguistic flourish and imagistic language, POEM_MAIN and POEM_A have some commonality, leading to a balanced judgment of BOTH.

- **Form:** POEM_B, similar to POEM_MAIN, adheres to a structured form in quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme, unlike POEM_A's more free-verse form, pushing the similarity towards POEM_B.

- **Emotion:** The main tone in POEM_MAIN (a haunting peace) relates ambiguously to both emotional upheaval (POEM_A) and hopeful, reassuring tones (POEM_B). Neither shares a distinct emotional tie, leading to a judgment of BOTH.

- **Overall:** Content ties with POEM_B, yet stylistic and emotional ambiguity results in a balanced judgment over qualitative elements compared to both, hence BOTH.
