  - **Form:** The poem is brief, with a consistent A-B-A-B rhyme scheme and a straightforward, rhythmic structure.

  - **Content:** Focuses on a desire for a natural resting place, expressing a preference for the beauty of nature over a traditional grave. The imagery involves nature elements like grass, flowers, and clouds.
  - **Emotion:** The tone balances between peacefulness and an implied sadness about burial and death.
  - **Style:** Uses vivid and pastoral imagery and uncomplicated syntax, with a gentle, contemplative rhythm.
  - **Form:** Composed of shorter lines and a regular rhyme scheme, lending a musical quality to the poem.

- **Summary POEM_B:**  
  - **Content:** Reminisces past joyful moments with a child in spring, juxtaposed against present loss and grief. The theme involves traversing from joyfulness to sorrow due to loss.

### Comparison:

- **Comparison content:**

- **Comparison style:**  
  POEM_B shares similar imagery and emotional layering seen in POEM_MAIN. It utilizes contrast effectively, reminiscent of the day-night dichotomy in POEM_MAIN, although POEM_A's nature focus and pastoral tone give it a different stylistic edge.

- **Comparison form:**  
  Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B are organized with thoughtful stanza structures and rhyme schemes. These structural similarities create a rhythmic storytelling experience not as predominant in POEM_A, which leans more towards pastoral lyricism.

- **Comparison emotion:**  
  POEM_B and POEM_MAIN carry an undercurrent of sadness and a subtle hope for comfort, whereas POEM_A suggests a peaceful acceptance, setting it apart from the otherwise somber tones. However, the emotional polarity (negative with glimmers of hope) is somewhat present in all three.

  POEM_MAIN aligns more closely with POEM_B due to shared themes of longing and loss, similar stylistic mechanisms, and structural elements. POEM_A, while emotionally resonant in its way, diverges more significantly in its content focus.

- **Comparison form:**  
  Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B share a more intricate rhyme scheme (ABAB in MAIN and ABA in B). They also have multiple stanzas, unlike POEM_A, which has a uniform and simpler structure that doesn’t match the rhythmical and stanzaic complexity of MAIN as closely as B does.

- **Comparison emotion:**  
  Emotionally, both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B convey a melancholic yet introspective and soothing tone, encouraging reflection and acceptance. POEM_A, with its focus on neglect and rediscovery, has a different emotional trajectory, though it also conveys a subtle tone of reflection.

- **Summary POEM_MAIN:**  
  POEM_MAIN presents a reflective and poignant narrative about the speaker's sense of alienation and nostalgia. The theme revolves around feelings of unfamiliarity with once-known places and the struggle to connect with personal history and relationships. Emotionally, the poem carries a melancholic and introspective tone, enriched with imagery of nature and the past (e.g., trees from childhood and old gardens). Stylistically, the poem uses figurative language—such as metaphor and symbolism—to convey deep emotional states. The form consists of a single stanza with a flowing, somewhat irregular meter and no strict rhyme scheme.

- **Summary POEM_A:**  
  POEM_A is a short, emotionally charged reflection on unexpected transformations and disillusionment. It contrasts past expectations with present realities—like a warm stream freezing into ice—and uses symbolism (e.g., the heaviness of a gold ring) to convey a sense of emotional burden and heartbreak. The emotions range from surprise to sorrow. The style is concise and uses direct language and vivid imagery. The poem consists of a single stanza with an ABAB rhyme scheme, enhancing its lyrical quality.

- **Summary POEM_B:**

- **Comparison style:**  
  Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B use metaphorical language and a contemplative style to explore deep emotional and philosophical themes. POEM_A, while also employing symbolism, presents a more concentrated and concise expression of emotional upheaval, which differs somewhat from the reflective style seen in POEM_MAIN.

- **Comparison form:**  
  Structurally, POEM_MAIN and POEM_B are more aligned, featuring longer stanzas and complex rhythmic patterns without strict adherence to a rhyme scheme. POEM_A is more straightforward, using a single stanza with a clear ABAB rhyme scheme, emphasizing lyrical simplicity.

- **Comparison emotion:**  
  POEM_MAIN shares a melancholic, introspective mood with both POEM_A and POEM_B. However, the intensity of sorrow and contemplation is closely mirrored in POEM_B, with POEM_A focusing more on the surprise and heaviness of disappointment rather than existential reflection.

### Summaries:

- **Summary POEM_MAIN:**
  - **Content:** POEM_MAIN discusses themes of love, hate, and the acceptance of all experiences except for stagnation, which it likens to death. The poem paints a vivid metaphor of life as a battle where stillness, or lack of emotion and action, results in being overcome by chaos (wild waves).
  - **Emotion:** The emotional tone is dynamic, moving between acceptance, courage, and a fear of insignificance.
  - **Style:** The language is metaphorical, using symbols like weather and the sea to discuss emotional states. There's a balanced use of contrasting ideas like love and hate, life and death.
  - **Form:** The poem is structured in quatrains with a succinct, consistent rhyme scheme contributing to its rhythmic quality.

- **Summary POEM_B:**
  - **Content:** POEM_B conveys a sense of profound melancholy and the pervasive presence of sadness in everyday life. It portrays a disconnection from the world, marked by an overwhelming existence of sorrow and the forgotten.
  - **Emotion:** The poem's emotional tone is deeply mournful, evoking a feeling of emptiness and lethargy.
  - **Style:** The language is rich in imagery, using heavy, dark symbols, such as ""black whirlpools"" and ""forgotten nights,"" with a somewhat abstract narrative style.
  - **Form:** The structure comprises two stanzas of varying lengths with no strict rhyme scheme, focusing more on the flow of emotion than formality.

- **Summary POEM_A:**
  - **Content:** POEM_A describes a physical environment marked by heavy, wet branches, dreary apricot blossoms, and muted elements of nature, capturing a moment in time during a cold season.

  - **Style:** Using vivid nature imagery, the style is descriptive with a focus on the shades and textures of natural scenery.
  - **Form:** The poem is structured in two quatrains with no rhyme, allowing the rich imagery to emphasize the scene's stillness.

### Comparison:

- **Comparison content:**
  - POEM_MAIN's content focuses on emotional themes of love, hate, and the fear of being unimportant. POEM_B aligns with this on the level of emotional depth and discomfort with stagnation (existential despair), while POEM_A centers more on nature scenes with limited emotional depth related to the human experience.
  
- **Comparison style:**
  - Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B use metaphors to convey complex emotional states, whereas POEM_A relies more on direct imagery of nature. POEM_B thus shares more stylistic similarities with POEM_MAIN than POEM_A does.

- **Comparison emotion:**
  - POEM_MAIN oscillates between extremes of love and hate, life and chaos, which parallels POEM_B's focus on profound sadness and lethargy. POEM_A maintains a more neutral, observational tone toward nature. However, both POEM_B and POEM_A connect with POEM_MAIN on emotional themes, albeit differently.

  - **Style:** The language is vivid and dramatic with strong imagery (e.g., ""reite durch die Nacht,"" ""Sturmes Graus""). The use of metaphor (specters) adds depth.
  - **Form:** Three stanzas, regular rhyme scheme, and concise pacing with a traditional lyrical structure.

- **Summary POEM_B:**
  - **Content:** Involves a protagonist demanding services—holding a horse and sword retrieval, with references to a lady and desires to be lost in the sky. Thematically, it explores desires, demands, and societal roles, juxtaposed with personal freedom.
  - **Emotion:** The tone is commanding and assertive, with an undertone of adventure or escapism.
  - **Style:** Language is straightforward yet vivid, with a strong, commanding voice.

---

### Comparison

- **Comparison content:**

POEM_A, in contrast, is philosophical and abstract, tending more toward introspective exploration.\n\n- **Comparison form:**\n  - POEM_MAIN and POEM_B both consist of three stanzas and have a more irregular rhyme scheme, contributing to a structured yet fluid form. POEM_A\'s four stanzas and consistent rhyme scheme involve a more formal and contemplative structure.\n\n- **Comparison emotion:**\n  - Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B evoke a sense of urgency and action (in the case of demands, journey), while POEM_A is more contemplative. However, POEM_MAIN uniquely blends an undercurrent of ominous tension that isn\'t directly present in the others.\n\n- **Comparison overall:**\n  - Given the thematic and stylistic similarities, POEM_B aligns more with POEM_MAIN in terms of narrative-driven elements and a dynamic, assertive emotional tone compared to the philosophical and reflective nature of POEM_A.\n\n---\n\n### Result\n\n```json\n{\n    ""content"": ""POEM_B"",\n    ""style"": ""POEM_B"",\n    ""form"": ""POEM_B"",\n    ""emotion"": ""BOTH"",\n    ""overall"": ""POEM_B""\n}\n```\n\nIn conclusion, POEM_B aligns more closely with POEM_MAIN compared to POEM_A across most dimensions, particularly in narrative content, stylistic expression, and structural form. The emotional comparison is less definitive but leans towards both POEM_B and POEM_A; however, in terms of action and assertiveness, POEM_B is a closer match.']"	prompts/eng_multi_cs_pgenr.txt	gpt-4o		testset	default

- **Summary POEM_MAIN:**  
  Content-wise, POEM_MAIN presents a contemplative portrayal of seasonal change, capturing a moment of fleeting beauty as roses at the forest's edge are about to wither. The setting evokes a transition from vibrant life to the calm of impending winter. The emotion is a mix of gentle melancholy and appreciation for the passing beauty. Stylistically, it uses simple, straightforward language with an invitation for the reader to partake in the fading moment. Structurally, it has a flowing form with a rhymed couplet format, contributing to a rhythmic subtlety.

- **Summary POEM_A:**  
  POEM_A expands on themes of transience and introspection, with a serene depiction of nightfall and the subsequent return of quietude. This carries a tone of resignation and nostalgia, perhaps pondering the transient nature of happiness. The style is highlighted by delicate, sensory language choices and a wistfulness woven throughout, emphasizing silence and calm. Formally, it follows a consistent quatrain structure with an ABAB rhyme scheme, enhancing its lyrical quality.

- **Summary POEM_B:**  
  POEM_B is darker, revolving around the theme of death meeting a young girl. There is a stark, narrative-driven content presenting death as a sweet release. The emotion conveyed is eerie, with a mix of acceptance and unsettling calmness. Stylistically, it employs a more dramatic and bold language, creating vivid imagery through direct dialogue. In terms of form, it follows a simple quatrain structure with abrupt and impactful rhymes, enhancing the stark narrative.

**Comparison:**

- **Comparison content:**  
  POEM_MAIN and POEM_A both explore themes of transience and the beauty of ephemeral moments, albeit in nature and life. POEM_B, however, focuses specifically on death, which stands apart from the seasonal and momentary theme in POEM_MAIN.

- **Comparison style:**  
  POEM_MAIN and POEM_A utilize gentle and sensory language with an emphasis on calm and beauty, aligning them stylistically. In contrast, POEM_B is bold, straightforward, and somewhat brusque, diverging from the subtlety of POEM_MAIN.

- **Comparison form:**  
  All poems possess simple quatrain structures, but POEM_B's rhyme scheme paired with its narrative drive offers stark contrast to the dream-like form of POEM_MAIN and POEM_A.

- **Comparison emotion:**  
  Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_A convey a nostalgic, introspective emotion, focusing on reflection. POEM_B's emotional tone is more unsettling and fatalistic, differing significantly except for the underlying theme of an ending or transition.

- **Comparison overall:**  
  Overall, POEM_A closely aligns with POEM_MAIN in terms of tone, style, and thematic exploration of transience and calm reflection. POEM_B offers a more dramatic, darker narrative, separating it from the introspective and gentle nature of POEM_MAIN.
