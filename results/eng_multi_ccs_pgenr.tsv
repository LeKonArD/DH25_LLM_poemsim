```

**Analysis:**

- **Content:** POEM_MAIN and POEM_A both touch upon the metaphor of life as a journey to the sea, though POEM_MAIN focuses more on solitude, while POEM_A is more about faith and destiny. Conversely, POEM_B centers around personal sacrifice and a relationship, which is quite different from the main poem’s existential theme.

- **Form:** POEM_B’s structured rhyme and extended stanza length resonate more with POEM_MAIN’s traditional quatrain form compared to POEM_A’s compressed two-line structure.

### Summaries:

- **Summary POEM_MAIN:**  
  - **Content:** This poem describes a scene in a meadow, focusing on a character named Marie who is so small that she gets lost among the grasses and flowers. The speaker muses about finding her again.
  - **Emotion:** The poem carries a light, whimsical, and slightly anxious tone, with emotions of wonder and a gentle sense of relief upon rediscovering Marie.
  - **Style:** The language is simple and playful, using repetition (""Auf der Wiese"") and vivid imagery to paint the scene. There's a childlike quality to the style.
  - **Form:** Composed in four quatrains, it follows a regular rhyme scheme that enhances the rhythmic flow.

- **Summary POEM_A:**  
  - **Content:** This poem depicts a city in a valley as night falls. It describes the enveloping fog and the isolation it causes, but ends with a glimmer of hope through a child's song amid the darkness.
  - **Emotion:** The progression moves from melancholic and eerie to hopeful, captured through the imagery of the light and song in the gloom.
  - **Style:** The poem uses descriptive language, with a shift from oppressive imagery to light and sound. There's a narrative progression from darkness to a soft uplifting point.
  - **Form:** Structurally, this poem has a less defined pattern compared to POEM_MAIN, with stanzas of varying lengths creating a more fluid form.

### Analysis:

- **Content:** POEM_MAIN and POEM_A share a more narrative and descriptive approach, focusing on a setting and scenarios unfolding within them (a meadow and a city). POEM_B, with its focus on internal struggle and assertive message, stands apart in thematic content.

- **Emotion:** Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_A explore shifts in emotion—from anxiety and darkness to lightness and hope—whereas POEM_B remains consistently assertive and motivational. This broad similarity leads to a ""BOTH"" evaluation for emotion.

- **Style:** POEM_MAIN's playful, descriptive style with elements of repetition and vivid imagery contrasts POEM_B's forceful, metaphor-heavy and directive style. POEM_A’s descriptive tone aligns more with POEM_MAIN but lacks its whimsical nature, while POEM_B offers a distinctive approach.

- **Form:** The regular stanza structure of POEM_MAIN is more similar to the structured, albeit more forceful arrangement of POEM_B than the varied form of POEM_A.
