POEM_MAIN\'s sense of impending doom and lack of family support is paralleled by POEM_A\'s depiction of the rising flood and eventual breaking of the jug.

POEM_B, however, maintains a more contemplative and serene tone, focusing on the enhancements provided by art, contrasting sharply with the anguish in the other poems."",\n  ""overall"": ""The overall similarity lies in the emotional and thematic exploration of personal struggle, vulnerability, and the intense emotional experiences depicted.
