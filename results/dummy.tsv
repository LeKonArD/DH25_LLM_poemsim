ANSWER:

{
""content"": ""POEM_B"",
""style"": ""POEM_B"", 
""form"": ""POEM_B"",
""emotion"": ""POEM_B"",
""overall"": ""POEM_B""
}

Reasoning:
1. Content: Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B are about spring/seasonal themes, nature's renewal, and emotional tension between hope and melancholy.

2. Style: Both use traditional German lyrical poetry structures with consistent rhyme and meter, with contemplative, introspective tones.

3. Form: Very similar - both have four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme and similar metrical patterns.

4. Emotion: Both express a complex emotional landscape - longing, subtle sadness despite natural beauty, a sense of unresolved inner conflict.

5. Overall similarity: POEM_B is markedly more similar to POEM_MAIN in its thematic exploration of seasonal change, inner emotional state, and poetic structure.

POEM_A, by contrast, has a more modernist, imagistic style with fragmented imagery and less structured form, making it less aligned with POEM_MAIN."
