### Content
- **POEM_MAIN** reflects on themes of humility, virtues, and societal structures, with references to historical context and a critical tone toward traditionally upheld values.
- **POEM_A** presents vivid imagery of nature with elements like a peacock, reeds, wood, and roses in a landscape setting. It carries no direct narrative or apparent message but focuses more on describing a scene through sensory details.
- **POEM_B** portrays a reflective scene in a park with people walking silently, capturing a moment of personal or shared experience. It suggests themes of companionship and observation.

When comparing content, **POEM_MAIN** is more narrative and thematic overall like **POEM_B** but with different subjects, while **POEM_A** focuses extensively on descriptive imagery with no apparent plot or clear message. Hence, in terms of thematic depth and narrative elements, **POEM_MAIN** is more similar to **POEM_B**.

### Emotion
- **POEM_MAIN** has a somewhat critical, questioning tone towards societal values and traditions, possibly evoking feelings of defiance or skepticism.
- **POEM_A** evokes a tranquil, contemplative mood with its focus on serene natural imagery, drawing on subtle emotional undertones of silence and beauty.
- **POEM_B** conveys a quiet, reflective emotion with its peaceful scene in a park, eliciting feelings of nostalgia or calmness.

The emotional undertone of **POEM_MAIN** somewhat aligns with **POEM_B** in its reflective nature, although **POEM_B** is more tranquil. **POEM_A** leans towards a serene appreciation of nature without the critical aspect of **POEM_MAIN**. Therefore, in terms of emotionality, **POEM_MAIN** is closer to **POEM_B**.

### Style
- **POEM_MAIN** uses direct language with a critical undertone, minimal figurative language, and a firm, almost assertive tone.
- **POEM_A** is heavily reliant on vivid imagery and rich, descriptive language, engaging multiple senses with its poetic style.
- **POEM_B** employs a straightforward, narrative style focusing on a descriptive moment in time.

**POEM_MAIN** and **POEM_B** share a more narrative and straightforward approach compared to the imagistic style of **POEM_A**. Thus, **POEM_MAIN** is stylistically more aligned with **POEM_B**.

### Form
- **POEM_MAIN** follows a structured stanza form, with lines that have a rhythm and a somewhat abrupt presentation.
- **POEM_A** consists of two stanzas with free-flowing lines focused on imagery, lacking rhyme or strict meter.
- **POEM_B** uses free verse, comprising simple, short lines to convey its scene without a strict formal structure.

Regarding form, **POEM_MAIN** shares a lightly structured stanzaic approach with both **POEM_B** and **POEM_A**, but **POEM_B** closely resembles its freer form with a narrative presence, so we attribute similarity here with **POEM_B** due to similar freedom and narrative structure.

### Overall
Considering the combined dimensions of content, emotion, style, and form, **POEM_MAIN** aligns more closely with **POEM_B** based on thematic depth, reflective emotion, narrative style, and freer poetic form.

### Content
- **POEM_MAIN** is about the connection of music and beautiful things to the memory and thought of a loved one.
- **POEM_A** involves a narrative of a day out, reflecting introspection in the evening, culminating in the realization of the loved one's presence in their happiness.
- **POEM_B** portrays a dreamlike state of the soul, with elements of longing and indifference, focusing on a sense of inner peace and dreams of happiness.

**Comparison:** 
Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_A center around the appreciation and introspection brought about by the thought of a loved one. POEM_B, while reflecting on the soul and dream state, focuses less directly on the concept of a specific beloved and more on a general sense of longing and peace. Thus, POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A in content.

### Emotion

- **POEM_A** carries emotions of reflection, realization, joy, and the comfort of a loved one's presence.
- **POEM_B** communicates a mixture of tranquility, longing, and subtle melancholy.

**Comparison:** 
POEM_MAIN resonates closely with the positive and reflective emotions found in POEM_A. POEM_B, while having elements of emotion, leans towards a more somber and indifferent emotionality. Thus, POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A in emotion.

### Style
- **POEM_MAIN** uses formal and vivid language to create a sense of reverence and beauty, employing metaphoric expressions and a calm, reflective tone.
- **POEM_A** uses narrative style with directness in its depiction of a day and realizations, with simpler language that is descriptive and straightforward.
- **POEM_B** has a lyrical and metaphorical style, with dreamlike imagery and a more abstract use of language.

**Comparison:** 
POEM_MAIN shares a formal and slightly metaphorical language style with POEM_B. POEM_A's style is more narrative and direct, differing from POEM_MAIN's approach. Therefore, POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_B in style.

### Form
- **POEM_MAIN** is in one stanza with alternating meter and no strict rhyme scheme.
- **POEM_A** is in two stanzas with rhyming couplets.
- **POEM_B** is also structured into stanzas with short verses and internal lyrical qualities, potentially without a strict rhyme pattern.

**Comparison:** 
Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_B have a free-form and flexible structure, while POEM_A follows a more traditional rhyming and stanza structure. POEM_MAIN is therefore more similar to POEM_B in form.

### Overall
Considering all the dimensions—content, emotion, style, and form—POEM_MAIN shows more similarity to POEM_A in content and emotion, but aligns more closely with POEM_B in style and form. The overall emotional and thematic resonance leans more towards POEM_A due to its closer alignment in content and emotion.

**Content**:  
POEM_MAIN and POEM_A share themes of love and emotional closeness, expressed through a setting of daily life and serenity, while POEM_B deals more with transformation and natural progression without the intimate focus. Therefore, POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A in content.

**Emotion**:  
Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_A convey emotions tied to love, joy, and a sense of bliss (e.g., ""selig macht"" and ""Seligkeit!"" respectively).

### Explanation of the Assessment

1. **Content**:
   - POEM_MAIN and POEM_A both explore themes of nature and elevation. POEM_MAIN describes the lark's flight and the soul's ascent, while POEM_A contrasts the lofty stature of a fir tree with the chatter of shrubs, emphasizing solitude and connection to the elements.

   - Therefore, POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A in terms of content.

2. **Emotion**:
   - POEM_MAIN conveys a sense of aspiration and spiritual elevation, akin to the uplifting tone in POEM_A with its depiction of the proud fir and the lofty thoughts exchanged with the storm.

   - POEM_MAIN aligns more closely with the emotion of elevation in POEM_A, but is closer to the emotional intimacy of love in POEM_B. Considering the emotional intensity and focus on pursuit, POEM_MAIN is slightly more similar emotionally to POEM_B.

3. **Style**:
   - POEM_MAIN and POEM_A both utilize nature imagery and reflective language. The language in POEM_MAIN is more formal and lyrical than the conversational imagery of POEM_B, although POEM_B presents its lines with a more intimate word choice.
   - Due to similar nature-based language and the grand, reflective style, POEM_MAIN is stylistically more similar to POEM_A.

### Content:
- **POEM_MAIN**: A whimsical conversation with a mouse, touching on themes of curiosity and gentle care, with a playful and caring tone. It mentions characters like ""Jakob"", ""Mama"", and ""Storch"" and focuses on a narrative around the mouse's journey.
- **POEM_A**: A philosophical reflection on human existence and the nature of time, with themes of awakening and the depth of the universe.
- **POEM_B**: Focuses on ambition, the need for foresight, and the judicious use of one's abilities, employing a series of aphorisms about personal conduct and intention.

POEM_MAIN is more narrative and light-hearted, similar to an address to a character (the mouse), while POEM_A is more introspective and existential. POEM_B does not share the same narrative style but focuses on aphorisms and practical wisdom. Thus, in terms of content, POEM_MAIN is more similar to **POEM_A** due to the addressing of a subject, albeit in a different context.

### Emotion:
- **POEM_MAIN**: Light-hearted, whimsical, and nurturing. It conveys warmth and curiosity.
- **POEM_A**: Reflective, philosophical, and profound, with an emotional depth exploring existential themes.
- **POEM_B**: Practical and logical, with little emotional charge, focusing on wisdom and self-awareness.

POEM_MAIN's emotional tone of warmth and care is closer to the introspective depth of POEM_A. Thus, for emotion, POEM_MAIN is more similar to **POEM_A**.

### Style:
- **POEM_MAIN**: Conversational, with questions and a playful tone. Uses simple language and repetition of a question format.
- **POEM_A**: Philosophical and metaphorical, with repetitive emphasis on the depth and eternity, focusing on abstract concepts.
- **POEM_B**: Highly structured with a didactic tone. Relies on parallelism and wordplay concerning mental faculties.

The stylistic choice of addressing and posing questions aligns more with **POEM_A** than with the aphoristic, structured style of POEM_B. Therefore, for style, POEM_MAIN is more similar to **POEM_A**.

### Form:
- **POEM_MAIN**: Comprises a series of questions, forming a loose and free structure with irregular rhyme and meter.
- **POEM_A**: Relatively short with a distinctive structure aiming for depth and repetition.
- **POEM_B**: Structured with clear rhyme and a rhythmic flow, focused on parallel structures.

Given POEM_MAIN's less structured form and similarity in length to POEM_A, by virtue of both being relatively short and less regular in structure, POEM_MAIN is more similar to **POEM_A**.

### Overall:
Given the analysis on content, emotion, style, and form, POEM_MAIN consistently aligns more with the qualities of POEM_A as it shares more dimensions with it. Thus, overall, it is more similar to **POEM_A**.

**Explanation:**

- **Content**: POEM_MAIN focuses on divine recognition and admiration, touching on how nature reflects the divine. POEM_B also uses nature (the imagery of light on water) as a metaphor for a lasting emotional impact, similar to how POEM_MAIN uses nature to express spirituality and emotional connection. POEM_A, on the other hand, deals with longing and a sense of journey without the explicit connection to a higher spiritual presence, making POEM_B more similar in content.

- **Emotion**: POEM_MAIN has a reverent, worshipful tone toward nature as a divine reflection. POEM_B shares a deeper emotional experience through its metaphor of enduring light in the soul, echoing the spiritual and emotional reflection found in POEM_MAIN. POEM_A, with its reflective and somewhat lonely tone, diverges emotionally by focusing more on personal longing and nostalgia, rather than the divine admiration in POEM_MAIN.

- **Style**: POEM_MAIN uses rich figurative language and expressions, focusing on natural imagery to convey its message. POEM_A also heavily employs imagery of nature and gentle movement to evoke emotionality and longing, making its style closer to POEM_MAIN compared to the more concise and specific imagery used in POEM_B.

- **Form**: Both POEM_MAIN and POEM_A have a fluid, gentle movement in structure, with apparent rhyming patterns and comparable stanza structures typical of classical poetic form. POEM_B, while it has a consistent form, uses a slightly more modern syntax, differentiating its form slightly from POEM_MAIN.

**Explanation:**

1. **Content**: POEM_MAIN and POEM_A both focus on themes of quietness and introspection, seen in the silent settings and subtle emotional undertones. POEM_MAIN describes a peaceful scene at dusk, while POEM_A reflects on a somber emotional state after a loved one leaves. POEM_B, however, has a more abstract and perhaps more intense, vivid depiction of surreal imagery, focusing less on a coherent narrative or emotion. Thus, POEM_MAIN is more similar to POEM_A in content.

2. **Emotion**: POEM_MAIN and POEM_A both express a melancholic or somber mood. POEM_MAIN describes a tranquil scene, evoking a sense of peace tinged with sadness as the day ends. POEM_A explicitly conveys sadness and loneliness. POEM_B, with its intense and vivid imagery, evokes contrasting and more chaotic emotions, separating it from the tranquil but melancholic atmosphere of POEM_MAIN. Therefore, POEM_MAIN is more emotionally similar to POEM_A.

3. **Style**: POEM_MAIN uses simple, natural imagery and straightforward language. POEM_A also uses a simple, narrative style focusing on emotional depth. POEM_B, on the other hand, is rich in abstract and vivid descriptions with a heightened use of figurative language. Due to this complexity and intensity, POEM_B's style is more distinct from POEM_MAIN's straightforward approach. Hence, POEM_MAIN is more similar in style to POEM_A, although my conclusion in the answer leans more towards the complexity linking it to POEM_B.

4. **Form**: POEM_MAIN and POEM_A have somewhat regular stanza structures and a moderate length. POEM_B is composed of dense imagery without a clear structure, differing considerably from POEM_MAIN's more structured form. Thus, POEM_MAIN and POEM_A are more similar in form.

POEM_MAIN describes a tranquil scene, evoking a sense of peace tinged with sadness as the day ends. POEM_A explicitly conveys sadness and loneliness. POEM_B, with its intense and vivid imagery, evokes contrasting and more chaotic emotions, separating it from the tranquil but melancholic atmosphere of POEM_MAIN. Therefore, POEM_MAIN is more emotionally similar to POEM_A.\n\n3. **Style**: POEM_MAIN uses simple, natural imagery and straightforward language. POEM_A also uses a simple, narrative style focusing on emotional depth. POEM_B, on the other hand, is rich in abstract and vivid descriptions with a heightened use of figurative language. Due to this complexity and intensity, POEM_B\'s style is more distinct from POEM_MAIN\'s straightforward approach. Hence, POEM_MAIN is more similar in style to POEM_A, although my conclusion in the answer leans more towards the complexity linking it to POEM_B.\n\n4. **Form**: POEM_MAIN and POEM_A have somewhat regular stanza structures and a moderate length. POEM_B is composed of dense imagery without a clear structure, differing considerably from POEM_MAIN\'s more structured form. Thus, POEM_MAIN and POEM_A are more similar in form.\n\nConsidering these aspects individually and collectively, POEM_MAIN aligns most closely with POEM_A.']"	prompts/eng_base_multi_binary_c.txt	gpt-4o		testset	default

**Content**: POEM_MAIN centers around familiar themes of home, solace, and the comforting embrace of nature, particularly focusing on the narrator's connection to the earth (""Schollen des Tales""). POEM_B also reflects on themes related to nature and the landscape, including a valley setting, as well as a sense of changes over time which align with the day transitioning to night. On the other hand, POEM_A concentrates on personal relationships and emotional connections, lacking the natural and contemplative themes present in POEM_MAIN.

**Emotion**: POEM_MAIN and POEM_B both have a reflective, somewhat melancholic tone with an underlying solace or illumination (as seen near the end of POEM_B with the ""light"" and ""lobgesang""). They both evoke a sense of contemplation and transition. However, POEM_A presents a more urgent emotional tone, focusing on love and loss, with vivid emotions of longing and warning. The emotional resonance and polarity of POEM_MAIN are more akin to those in POEM_B.

Similar formal features and a focus on stanza rhythmic flow align with POEM_MAIN more than the narrative, imperative-driven form of POEM_A.

   - **POEM_B** explores themes of the night, with cosmic and eternal elements, and the personal introspection it provokes, touching on sleep and existential feelings.
   
   POEM_MAIN and POEM_A deal with personal emotions in response to natural phenomena, but POEM_MAIN uses it as a metaphor for internal strife, whereas POEM_A focuses on hope and renewal. POEM_B is more about existential reflection without the specific metaphor of clouds and worries.
